Valid Parentheses
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1.Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

The stack data structure can come in handy here in representing 
this recursive structure of the problem. We can't really process this from 
the inside out because we don't have an idea about the overall structure. 
But, the stack can help us process this recursively i.e. 
from outside to inwards.
